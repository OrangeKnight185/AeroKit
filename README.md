# AeroKit: An aerodynamics toolbox for Python

The vision for this repository is to host a Python package capable of basic calculations similar to those found in undergraduate aerospace engineering coursework. The first target for this package is compressible flow relations. This means no more pesky tables! Exact results can be given instead of requiring interpolation between table entries.

# Properties of Streamlines

## Definition
A streamline is a curve tangential to the velocity vector at any point.

Properties:
 1. Provides flow direction information.
 2. Streamlines can't cross unless at a stagnation point.
 3. Are instantaneous - vary with time unless steady flow.
 4. If the velocity components are known, $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{v}{u}$. An equation for the streamlines is then obtained via integration.

## Flow Velocity from Streamlines
One streamline only gives the direction of the flow, but since streamlines are impermeable, adjacent streamlines give the flow velocity via mass conservation.
